Here are build instructions for various platforms, 
provided for convenience.  We recommend using the
Makefile and GCC. 

DISCLAIMER:  
	You may use Visual Studio/Eclipse, for development,
 	but the project MUST BUILD and run correctly on the
	myth machines (myth.stanford.edu) using the Makefile.
	If your project does not build, we cannot grade it!!

Sincerely,
cs249a TAs


Visual Studio: 
	Use vs2008/assignment1.sln to build the project.

Eclipse + MinGW: 
	Rename mingw.project and mingw.cproject to .project 
 	and .cproject, then open from Eclipse.

Eclipse + GCC:
	Rename gcc.project and gcc.cproject to .project and
	.cproject, then open from Eclipse.

Makefile:
	Run 'make' in the top-level directory.
